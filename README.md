# How to Get Unbanned on Hearthstone (2025 Guide) 🔥

Getting banned from Hearthstone can really sting, especially if you’re convinced it was a blunder. Don’t rage-quit just yet! This handy guide will help you figure out what went wrong and how to charm Blizzard into giving you back your beloved account.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your Hearthstone ban hit you hard right after you made a fresh Blizzard account? Or do bans keep following you like a relentless card draw? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Blizzard has put a target on your PC’s hardware, so even new accounts get smoked.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your emails or Blizzard notifications carefully to find out why your Hearthstone account got benched. Some usual suspects behind bans:
- Using cheats or unauthorized add-ons that break the rules  
- Toxic flaming, harassment, or unsportsmanlike behavior  
- Sharing accounts or suspicious payment activity

**Pro tip:** Review Blizzard’s Terms of Service before firing off an appeal.

## Step 2: Collect Your Information 📝

- Your Blizzard account email  
- Your Hearthstone battletag or username  
- The date your account was banned  
- Any screenshots, warning messages, or error codes
